                    <h2>HackFrost 3.0 Hackathon - 1st Place Winner</h2>
                    <p>HackFrost 3.0 was a hackathon targetted at tackling emissions from industrial transportation. Our
                        team, Viridis,
                        designed a DIY kit for retrofitting long-haul trucks with solar-powered Auxilliary Power Units
                        (APUs) - a solution
                        that is near-immediately deployable, scalable and with the potential to annually offset 1.5x
                        NYC's annual emissions
                        every year if deployed across North America. Over 150 people participated at the event.

                    <p>Google CodeU is a 12 week invitation-only virtual program, composed of 150 high potential
                        undergraduates
                        pursuing Computer Science in North America. At the end of the program we were hosted over for a
                        3-day retreat
                        at Google's Headquarters in Mountain View :)</p>

                    <h2>Bounce Hackathon - 2023</h2>
                    <p>The 2023 Bounce Hackathon was targetted at addressing employment retention issues in the health
                        sector
                        within NL. As part of this Hackathon, I developed a rough simulation of the impact of employee
                        churnout
                        on the workload of remaining team members, and how the current rate of churnout relative to
                        employment
                        was resulting in an ongoing cycle of churnout due to workload instability.

                    <p>At Startup Weekend 2017 our team designed a solution for extending internet connectivity out at
                        sea through a network
                        of buoys acting as cell towers, allowing oil rigs to stay on top of the latest updates for
                        iceberg locations and take
                        preventitive action.
