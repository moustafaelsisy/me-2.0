                    <p>HackFrost 3.0 was a hackathon targetted at tackling emissions from industrial transportation. Our
                        team, Viridis,
                        designed a DIY kit for retrofitting long-haul trucks with solar-powered Auxilliary Power Units
                        (APUs) - a solution
                        that is near-immediately deployable, scalable and with the potential to annually offset 1.5x
                        NYC's annual emissions
                        every year if deployed across North America. Over 150 people participated at the event.

                        undergraduates
                        pursuing Computer Science in North America. At the end of the program we were hosted over for a

                    <p>The 2023 Bounce Hackathon was targetted at addressing employment retention issues in the health
                        sector
                        within NL. As part of this Hackathon, I developed a rough simulation of the impact of employee
                        churnout
                        on the workload of remaining team members, and how the current rate of churnout relative to
                        employment
                        was resulting in an ongoing cycle of churnout due to workload instability.

                    <p>At Startup Weekend 2017 our team designed a solution for extending internet connectivity out at
                        sea through a network
                        of buoys acting as cell towers, allowing oil rigs to stay on top of the latest updates for
                        iceberg locations and take
                        preventitive action.

                            <h4>Computational Intelligence Methods for Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (CIBB) - 2021</h4>

                            Bacterial small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are ubiquitous regulatory RNAs involved in controlling several cellular processes by targeting multiple mRNAs. The large diversity of sRNAs in terms of their length, sequence, and function poses a challenge for computational sRNA prediction. In this paper, we combine ensemble learning over genomic context features with sequence-derived features to invent a model with demonstrably higher predictive performance according to measurements of AUPRC against current state of the art models.
