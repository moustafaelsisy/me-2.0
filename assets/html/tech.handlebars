            <h2>HackFrost 3.0 Hackathon - 1st Place Winner</h2>
            <p>HackFrost 3.0 was a hackathon targetted at tackling emissions from industrial transportation. Our team, Viridis,
                designed a DIY kit for retrofitting long-haul trucks with solar-powered Auxilliary Power Units (APUs) - a solution
                that is near-immediately deployable, scalable and with the potential to annually offset 1.5x NYC's annual emissions
                every year if deployed across North America. Over 150 people participated at the event.

            <h2>Googleplex - Google CodeU Retreat (2018)</h2>
            <p>Google CodeU is a 12 week invitation-only virtual program, composed of 150 high potential undergraduates
            pursuing Computer Science in North America. At the end of the program we were hosted over for a 3-day retreat
            at Google's Headquarters in Mountain View :)</p>

            <h2>Bounce Hackathon - 2023</h2>
            <p>The 2023 Bounce Hackathon was targetted at addressing employment retention issues in the health sector
                within NL. As part of this Hackathon, I developed a rough simulation of the impact of employee churnout
                on the workload of remaining team members, and how the current rate of churnout relative to employment
                was resulting in an ongoing cycle of churnout due to workload instability.

            <h2>Startup Weekend 2017 - 1st Place Winner</h2>
            <p>At Startup Weekend 2017 our team designed a solution for extending internet connectivity out at sea through a network
                of buoys acting as cell towers, allowing oil rigs to stay on top of the latest updates for iceberg locations and take
                preventitive action.

            <h2>Newfoundland Developers (NDev) Talk - September 2022</h2>
            <p>At this talk I presented some of the theory behind Microserviced architectures, and common misconceptions
                in practice within the industry on how and when they should be implemented.
